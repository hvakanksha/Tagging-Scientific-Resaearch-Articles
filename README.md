Path Taken:

The data was cleaned and preprocessed using NLP techniques like Stemming and Tokenization, setting up of stopwords was done; unecessaery elements like HTML Strips , special characters, squared brackets, Noisy Text were removed. After this three approaches were used: TFIDF, Word2vector and a combination of both. Various Machine Learning Algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost were applied to it.
